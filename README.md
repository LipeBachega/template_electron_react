🗃️ Database

This project uses SQLite as its database, accessed through Sequelize (a JavaScript/TypeScript ORM). The basic setup is already included, but you can customize or add new models as needed in the src/database folder.

🎨 Styling with Tailwind CSS
Tailwind CSS allows for quick styling with utility classes. For further customization, modify the tailwind.config.js file.

📜 Available Scripts
In package.json, you’ll find helpful scripts for development and production:

npm start: Starts the development environment.
npm run build: Builds the project for production.
npm run lint: Runs code linting.
